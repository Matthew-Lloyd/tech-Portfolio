                          How do you summarize a life? There are so many different elements and working parts... 
                          How do you know what's relevant and what is not? I suppose you start with introductions.

                          Hello World! My name is Matthew Lloyd. I am a human with an analytical mind trapped inside a body with a
                           lot of heart. I've spent my early work career climbing the corporate ladder of a Fortune 500 company, 
                           and found myself wanting more. Along the way I have picked up a variety of skills and experience that 
                           have proven invaluable in the world of business. Among these are things like time management, mentorship, 
                           adaptability & flexibility, business ownership, on-the-fly problem solving, and exceptional people skills.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                          More recently, Iâ€™ve dived head first into the world of Full-Stack Web Development and am loving every 
                          minute of it!! I can't overstate how much I was made for this kind of work! This has added a whole new 
                          array (pun intended) of skills and experience ranging from Client-side technologies like HTML, CSS, 
                          JQuery, Handlebars & React.js to Server-side tech such as Node.js, Express, mySQL/Sequelize, & MongoDB. 
                          In other words, the MERN stack toolkit is my arsenal of choice; though I'm not so limited to say this 
                          is the ONLY way.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                          I am looking for a career that will challenge & inspire me on a day-to-day basis and allow me to tap 
                          into the reservoir that is my full potential. I am a fast & eager learner and am willing to go out of 
                          my comfort zone to do so. Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile, and have a blessed day!
                          </p>
